Make sure you have installed the drivers, then plug in the quad
choose the USB port the quad is connected to then simply click
the button for the quad you want to calibrate, please note this
tool does not clear the 40011 and 40021 error for that you need
another method which i will link a video guide to here once i have
set it up
